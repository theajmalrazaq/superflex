# 🚀 SuperFlex AI: The Ultimate Prompting Masterclass

SuperFlex AI isn't just a chatbot; it's a high-performance academic engine that lives inside your portal. It "hears" your data and "sees" your goals. To unlock its full potential, you need to know how to talk to it.

## 🧠 How SuperFlex AI "Sees" Your Data
SuperFlex AI operates on a **"Stealth Sync"** architecture. It doesn't just guess; it reads the actual HTML of your portal.

*   **⚡ Automatic Sync**: Every time you visit the **Home**, **Marks**, or **Attendance** pages, the AI silently updates its memory in the background.
*   **📚 Deep Scan (One-Time Necessity)**: The AI needs to "read" your **Transcript** and **Study Plan** at least once per session to know your academic history. If it feels "clueless" about your past semesters, just hop over to the Transcript page for 1 second.

## 🎯 The "C.S.G." Framework for Perfect Prompts
To get precise answers instead of generic advice, follow this structure:

1.  **Context**: Which semester or specific subject are we talking about?
2.  **Specificity**: What is the exact metric (CGPA, SGPA, weighted average, attendance percentage)?
3.  **Goal**: What do you want to calculate or simulate?

**❌ Bad Prompt**: "How are my grades?"
**✅ God Prompt**: "Based on my current semester marks, calculate my forecasted grade in 'Numerical Computing' if I average 80% in the remaining assignments."

## 💡 Advanced Sample Prompts

### 1. 📊 Marks & Relative Grading (MCA)
SuperFlex AI understands **MCA (Relative Grading)** curves.
*   *"Looking at my current marks and the MCA data from the transcript page, what is the safest range for an A grade in Data Structures?"*
*   *"I just got 15/20 in my Quiz 2. How does this affect my weighted average in this course compared to the class average?"*
*   *"Create a table showing my total obtained weighted marks vs. total weight for all current subjects."*

### 2. 📅 The "Bunker" Mode (Attendance Optimization)
Use the AI to manage your attendance like a pro.
*   *"Which subjects am I closest to the 80% threshold in? Tell me exactly how many classes I can still miss per subject."*
*   *"I have a family event next Tuesday. If I miss my 'Compiler Construction' lecture, what will my new attendance percentage be?"*
*   *"List all my absent dates for the month of October in a chronological list."*

### 3. 🔮 "What-If" Simulations (The Sandbox)
This is where SuperFlex AI shines. It can predict your future based on your past.
*   *"Assume I get a 'B+' in my final project but 'A's in everything else this semester. What will be my new CGPA?"*
*   *"I want to reach a 3.5 CGPA by the end of my 6th semester. Given my current 2.9, what SGPA do I need to maintain for the next two semesters?"*
*   *"Calculate my SGPA if I retake 'Object Oriented Programming' and replace my current 'D' grade with a 'B+'."*

### 4. 🗺️ Degree Roadmap & Graduation
*   *"According to my Tentative Study Plan, how many 'Core' subjects do I have left to complete?"*
*   *"Am I on track to graduate on time? Show me any prerequisites I haven't cleared yet."*

### 🎭 5. Persona Adoption (Change the Vibe)
You can change how the AI speaks to you to match your mood.
*   **The Strict Counselor**: *"Act as a very strict academic counselor. Roast my current GPA and tell me exactly where I'm being lazy."*
*   **The Chill Senior**: *"Act as a chill senior who has seen it all. Give me some survival tips for 'Theory of Automata' based on my current marks."*
*   **The Strategist**: *"Think like a strategic consultant. How can I optimize my study hours to maximize my CGPA with the least effort?"*

## 🏛️ University Specific Hacks (NUCES/Flex)
SuperFlex AI is specifically tuned for the NUCES Flex system.
*   **Relative Grading (MCA)**: Always ask the AI to factor in the "MCA" when predicting grades. Relative grading is the heart of the Flex portal, and the AI is the only tool that can decode those curves for you.
*   **Attendance Debar**: The AI knows about the 80% rule. Use it to stay safe.
*   **Retake Strategy**: Ask: *"Is it worth retaking [Course Name] next semester, or should I focus on improving my current semester's GPA first?"*

## 🪄 Pro Techniques

### 🧠 Chain of Thought (Reasoning)
Ask the AI to show its work.
*   *"Evaluate my performance in 'Operating Systems'. First, look at my quiz averages, then my mid-term, and finally estimate my final grade based on the weightage."*

### 📑 Formatting for Clarity
*   *"Summarize my attendance for all subjects in a Markdown table with columns: Subject, Percentage, Classes Missed, and Status."*
*   *"Explain the CGPA calculation logic you just used step-by-step so I can verify it."*

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting "Memory Loss"
If the AI says: *"I don't have access to your transcript data yet..."*
1.  **The Fix**: Navigate to the **Transcript** page.
2.  **The Wait**: Wait for the green toast notification: ✅ **Transcript Sync Complete!**
3.  **The Result**: Go back to the chat. The AI now knows everything about your academic past.
