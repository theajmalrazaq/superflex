# SuperFlex AI: The Ultimate Prompting Masterclass

SuperFlex AI isn't just a chatbot; it's a high-performance academic engine that lives inside your portal. It "hears" your data and "sees" your goals. To unlock its full potential, you need to know how to talk to it.

## How SuperFlex AI "Sees" Your Data

SuperFlex AI operates on a **Stealth Sync** architecture. It reads the actual HTML of your portal to build its memory.

- **Automatic Sync (At Login)**: When you log in, SuperFlex automatically syncs data from **Home**, **Marks**, **Attendance**, and **Study Plan** pages in the background.
- **On-Demand Sync (Transcript)**: The **Transcript** page syncs only when you visit it. This prevents logout issues that occurred with heavy background syncing. Visit the Transcript page at least once per session for comprehensive AI context.

## Choosing Your AI Engine

SuperFlex lets you switch between different "brains." Select the right tool for the job.

| **GPT-4o Mini**      | **Default Driver.** Fast, efficient and reliable for everyday academic tasks.                       |
| **Gemini 2.0 Flash** | **Speed.** Balanced intelligence with high-speed response times.                                    |
| **Claude Haiku**     | **Nuance.** Excellent for structured analysis and empathetic responses.                             |
| **Gemini 3 Pro**     | **Complex Logic.** Use this for deep "What-If" simulations and grade predictions.                   |
| **Grok 2**           | **Direct Coaching.** Best for blunt interactions like "Roast my GPA" or strict performance reviews. |
| **Gemini 3 Flash**   | **Lightning Fast.** Good for quick summaries of long academic histories.                            |

## The "C.S.G." Framework for Perfect Prompts

To get precision, include three elements in your prompt:

1.  **Context**: The subject or semester (e.g., "In Numerical Computing...")
2.  **Specificity**: The exact metric (e.g., "...calculate the weighted average...")
3.  **Goal**: The desired outcome (e.g., "...to forecast my final grade.")

> **Bad Prompt**: "How are my grades?"
>
> **God Prompt**: "Based on my current semester marks, calculate my forecasted grade in 'Numerical Computing' if I average 80% in the remaining assignments."

## Advanced Prompt Library

### 1. Marks & Relative Grading (MCA)

_SuperFlex understands the NUCES relative grading curves._

- **Safe Range Analysis**:
  > "Looking at my current marks and the MCA data from the transcript page, what is the safest range for an A grade in Data Structures?"
- **Impact Analysis**:
  > "I just got 15/20 in my Quiz 2. How does this affect my weighted average in this course compared to the class average?"
- **Summary Table**:
  > "Create a table showing my total obtained weighted marks vs. total weight for all current subjects."

### 2. The Bunker Mode (Attendance)

_Optimize your skips without getting debarred._

- **Threshold Check**:
  > "Which subjects am I closest to the 80% threshold in? Tell me exactly how many classes I can still miss per subject."
- **Future Simulation**:
  > "I have a family event next Tuesday. If I miss my 'Compiler Construction' lecture, what will my new attendance percentage be?"
- **Log View**:
  > "List all my absent dates for the month of October in a chronological list."

### 3. "What-If" Simulations

_Predict the future based on current trajectory._

- **CGPA Prediction**:
  > "Assume I get a 'B+' in my final project but 'A's in everything else this semester. What will be my new CGPA?"
- **Target Setting**:
  > "I want to reach a 3.5 CGPA by the end of my 6th semester. Given my current 2.9, what SGPA do I need to maintain for the next two semesters?"
- **Retake Impact**:
  > "Calculate my SGPA if I retake 'Object Oriented Programming' and replace my current 'D' grade with a 'B+'."

### 4. Degree Roadmap & Personas

- **Roadmap**: "According to my Tentative Study Plan, how many 'Core' subjects do I have left to complete?"
- **Graduation Check**: "Am I on track to graduate on time? Show me any prerequisites I haven't cleared yet."

**Try Different Personas:**

- **Strict Counselor**: "Act as a strict academic counselor. Roast my current GPA and tell me where I'm being lazy."
- **Chill Senior**: "Act as a chill senior. Give me survival tips for 'Theory of Automata' based on my current marks."
- **Strategist**: "Think like a consultant. How can I optimize my study hours to maximize CGPA with minimal effort."

## University Specific Hacks (NUCES/Flex)

- **Relative Grading**: Always ask the AI to factor in "MCA" (Relative Grading) when predicting grades.
- **Attendance Debar**: The AI helps you skirt the line of the 80% rule safely.
- **Retake Logic**: Ask for a Cost-Benefit Analysis: "Is it worth retaking X or strictly focusing on current GPA?"

## Pro Techniques

- **Chain of Thought**: Ask the AI to show steps.
  - _Example_: "Evaluate my OS performance. First look at quiz averages, then mid-term, then estimate final grade."
- **Formatting**: Request specific layouts.
  - _Example_: "Summarize attendance in a Markdown table with columns: Subject, Percentage, Classes Missed, Status."

## Troubleshooting

**"Memory Loss"** or Missing Data?
If the AI says "I don't have transcript data":

1.  Go to the **Transcript** page.
2.  Wait for the **"Transcript Sync Complete"** notification.
3.  Return to the chat.

## Privacy & Reliability

- **Data Transmission**: While SuperFlex logic runs locally in your browser, your specific query and relevant context are sent to the **Puter.js** AI infrastructure to generate responses from your selected model (e.g., Google, OpenAI, etc).
- **Estimation**: AI provides **estimates**. Always verify critical calculations with your coordinator.

_Developed for the dreamers, the grinders, and the ones who just want to Flex._
